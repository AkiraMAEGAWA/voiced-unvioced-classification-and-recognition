# The purpose of this project is recognising and classifing unvoices in someway.

1. first: get sufficient unvoiced wave data from throat 
2. second: classify these data into sound
3. third: recognize what you think(say)


when I and my colaborators get data, we have to correspand
not only wave data but also what we want subject to think silently by the same time.
